This is a project to help motivate users who had a heart attack or stroke.

Key Functionalities:<br /> 
Record activity labels via ExtraSensory app.<br />
Tally up the hours they have been performing that action.<br />
Forward the data to their physician as a presentable graph<br /> 
Receive feedback from the physician.<br />
Warns family/physician about decreased activity levels over a period of time(2-3
        days delirium) because heart attack/stroke doesn’t happen all at once.<br />
List of Screens: Login, Goal setting, Graphical</br>

Our app takes a black box approach of keeping the patient’s identity anonymous.
Only the patient and physician knows each other’s identities. We would only use a hashed ID to correlate their data.
